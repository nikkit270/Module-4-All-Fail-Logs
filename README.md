Exercise 3:
Topic Modeling in R, DH box version - Fail Log

I am having so much trouble logging onto the Studio section of the DH box page. I keep trying but my page won’t load. So, I am going to go onto my system preferences and perhaps alter the security of the page, because a note popped onto search bar at the top where the URL is stating “unsecure”. 
I tried to alter the security but I still couldn’t log in. I tried to log in on Google Chrome instead of using Safari or Firefox, and Chrome helped me log in. After I logged into RStudio I began plugging in the codes. I plugged them all in as directed. I had no issues until I reached the “Importaing data directly from the web”.  No data would appear from the “Values” section of the RStudio page even after attempting to correctly plug in the codes.
